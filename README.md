## WHY
An immersive world whereby one can enter and experience the mind of a person undergoing psychosis like states. Given that the simulator was designed and created already, part of Jeniffer Kanary’s PhD work, our goal for the past two days was to provide an initial neuroscientific validation of how well the simulator is able to create a transient ‘’psychotic’’ like state.

## WHAT
The subject undergoing the simulation, is prepared by placing a set of VR goggles, and during the experience Jennifer Kanary interacts with the subject to provide an additional layer of dissonance to the experienceScientific evidence point to altered neurophysiological signatures in the brain of psychotic patients.

## HOW
Therefore, via the use of EEG techniques, we recorded the subjects’ brain activity before, during, and after the simulation. For this, we used a neurophysiological measurement called P300, that reflects brain activity associated with stimulus evaluation and categorization. We evoked a P300 response with a visual oddball task.

The simulator has the potential of providing researchers the opportunity to further study psychosis-like states of mind. However, a scientific evaluation of the validity of the simulator is currently absent. Therefore, we chose to use the hackathon time and resources and combine the artistic and scientific knowhow to provide pilot data regarding the validity of the simulator. The simulator combines a set of VR goggles, headphones, and a laptop that provides the mixed reality interactive simulation. The game engine was created with SuperCollider and Quartz Composer. A Mobita eeg headset was used in combination with acquisition and analysis Matlab written by Jason Last
